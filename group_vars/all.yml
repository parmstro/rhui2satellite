# yamllint disable rule:line-length
# rhui2satellite_cloud: "azure"  # valid values: azure

# This command is currently a copy and paste operation in this playbook.
# Eventually I will swap it out so that we make an API call to Satellite to get the command
# based on the configuration that you request.
# For now, in the Satellite UI Navigate to
#   Hosts -> Register Host
# Fill out the form:
# Ensure that you select the proper values for:
#   Organization
#   Location  - this is important if you are running a capsule in the cloud. (Hint: you should!)
#   Host Group  - this is very valuable if you are following the RH-ISAM and using Satellite to deploy your cloud instances (Hint: you should!)
#   Capsule  - if you have multiple or a load balancer
#   Activation Keys  - this is hugely important!! You can set this up by group in your inventory (remember this is the all.yml file)

# Now click generate and copy the command into the value for satellite_reg_cmd
# Set your inventory and run the main.yml = you should be good to go

# satellite_reg_cmd: "set -o pipefail && curl -sS --insecure 'https://sat.example.com/register?activation_keys=azure8&force=true&location_id=3&organization_id=1&packages=katello-host-tools+katello-host-tools-tracer&update_packages=false' -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.this_is_a_really_long_string.HHOedB5pUNC5XUcv2ooxzHcuBfm_Crr0FZpyd_rPMWQ' | bash"
